This project is available at: http://utfcpp.sourceforge.net/

Version is utf8_v2_3_1.zip

Since this is a light-weight header-file-only project, I create ``include'' directory and copy the contents in original ``source'' directory into it.

I add test examples in directory ``test_utfcpp''. 

I add a special macro in the header file to indicate whether the header has been included.

    utfcpp/include/utf8.h:34:  #define NSVIRGO_NSUTF8      //  define header macro
